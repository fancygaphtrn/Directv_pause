Chrome extension to pause your Directv DVR

I use this to quickly pause my DVR.   Mostly when the phone rings.

Instead of hunting for the remote, it is always right there on my Chrome screen.


Extract the files to your your computer.   I put them in a folder in My documents called directv_pause.

Then in Chrome:

Sselect settings, Tools, Extensions.

At the top of screen select Developer mode.  New buttons will appear

Select Load unpacked extension.

Select the folder you put the download files in.

After installed, right click on the icon at the top right of the Chrome bar, select options and enter the IP address of your DVR.

You can find the IP address of your DVR in the DVR settings.
